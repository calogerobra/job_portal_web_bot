# A Selenium-based bot for downloading PDFs from a javascript-heavy job portal. 
This project is an example for a Selenium-based web bot, which is used to automatically navigate through a job portal that discloses postings only in form of PDFs and where PDF links are not embedded in the source code but connected to javascripts.
The crawler is part of an academic project to monitor job market developments during the COVID-19 pandemic.
